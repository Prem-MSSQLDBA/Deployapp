## Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This Capstone project will utilize CI/CD and cloud services learned during the Udacity - AWS Cloud DevOps Engineer nanodegree.

Plan what your pipeline will look like.
Decide which options you will include in your Continuous Integration phase. Use either Circle CI or Jenkins.
Pick a deployment type - either rolling deployment or blue/green deployment.
For the Docker application you can either use an application which you come up with, or use an open-source application pulled from the Internet, or if you have no idea, you can use an Nginx “Hello World :)” application.
